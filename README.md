# Hate Speech Detection in Amharic

## Empowering a more inclusive online experience with cutting-edge technology.

This project tackles the critical issue of hate speech in the Amharic language by combining user-friendly design with intelligent NLP detection. By harnessing the power of technology, we aim to foster a safer and more respectful online environment for Amharic speakers worldwide.

## Key Features:

Accurate Detection: A robust NLP model trained on real-world data to identify hate speech with high precision.
Seamless Interface: Next.js framework with a sleek Tailwind CSS design creates a user-friendly and intuitive platform.
Scalable Architecture: Django handles server-side logic and ensures smooth interaction with the NLP model.
Comprehensive Solution: Combines advanced technology with a user-friendly interface for widespread impact.
## Technical Details:

Frontend: 
- Technology: Developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework.
- Design: Features a modern and user-friendly interface, aesthetically crafted with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- User Experience: Emphasizes ease of use, with an intuitive layout that simplifies interaction and navigation.
  
Backend: 
- Framework: Built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), renowned for its robust server-side capabilities.
- Functionality: Manages server logic and seamlessly interfaces with the NLP model for efficient processing.
  
NLP Model: 
- Core: The heart of the application is a sophisticated NLP model.
- Training: Specially trained to recognize and categorize hate speech in Amharic text with high accuracy.
- Purpose: Aims to contribute significantly to the mitigation of hate speech in digital Amharic content.
  
## Usage:

Visit the project website (link here).
Enter an Amharic phrase in the designated field.
Click "Analyze" and receive a clear classification: "Hate Speech" or "Not Hate Speech."
## Examples:

Input: "ሁሉም ሰዎች እኩል አይደሉም።" (Not all people are equal.)
Output: Hate Speech
Input: "ትክክለኛውን ታሪክ እንነግራለን።" (We will tell the true story.)
Output: Not Hate Speech
## Limitations:

No NLP model is perfect, and this system faces similar limitations. Some complex or nuanced hate speech might go undetected, highlighting the need for continuous improvement.
